# Page View Time Series Visualizer

This project visualizes time series data for daily page views from May 2016 to December 2019.

The project demonstrates how to use **Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn** to create:

1. **Line Plot** – Shows daily page views over time.
2. **Bar Plot** – Shows average monthly page views grouped by year.
3. **Box Plots** – Shows distribution of page views by year (trend) and by month (seasonality).

The dataset (`fcc-forum-pageviews.csv`) is cleaned by removing the top and bottom 2.5% of page views to filter out outliers.
